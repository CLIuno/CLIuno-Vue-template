## Notes

### vue Content

With vue Content, you can just create markdown file (recommended) inside `content` folder.  
But this is only available for SSR (Server Side Rendering) mode. Static mode still not working, you can see the issue <https://github.com/vue/content/issues/1202>
For now, you can follow

### Custom Workspace Snippets

This workspace including custom snippets for VSCode.

- **n3:content**  
  content template with markdown
- **n3:page**  
  page template

### Styles

Tailwindcss import managed by windicss.
and you can add custom styles in :

```bash
/path/to/assets/sass/app.scss
```

### Theme (Dark Mode)

ThemeManager is a plugin that allows you to switch between themes. this lib in :

```bash
/path/to/utils/theme.ts
```

`Thememanager` is a function-class construct when app.vue before mounted. theme construct inside `AppSetup()` in `/path/to/app.vue` :

```vue
<!-- /path/to/app.vue -->
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { AppSetup } from '~/utils/app'
// app setup
AppSetup()
</script>
```

To change theme, you can direct set theme from state `theme.setting`, example :

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { IThemeSettingOptions } from '~/utils/theme'
const themeSetting = useState<IThemeSettingOptions>('theme.setting')
themeSetting.value = 'dark'
</script>
```

When you change state `theme.setting`, it will automatically change theme.

Theme Setting have 4 options :

- `light`
- `dark`
- `system` (operating system theme)
- `realtime` (realtime theme, if 05:00 - 17:00, it will change to light theme, otherwise dark)

We have state `theme.current`, this state return `light` or `dark` theme. basically it's process from `theme.setting`.
dont change theme with this state.

### Localization

Localization is a plugin that allows you to switch between languages. this lib in :

```bash
/path/to/utils/lang.ts
```

`LanguageManager` is a function-class construct when app.vue before mounted.
this lib depend on [@intlify/vue3](https://github.com/intlify/vue3)
lang construct inside `AppSetup()` in `/path/to/app.vue` :\

```vue
<!-- /path/to/app.vue -->
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { AppSetup } from '~/utils/app'
// app setup
AppSetup()
</script>
```

To change language, you can direct set language from state `lang.setting`, example :

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
const langSetting = useState<string>('locale.setting')
langSetting.value = 'en'
</script>
```

When you change state `locale.setting`, it will automatically change language.

### Generate Locales

I made an automatic tool to automatically translate to all languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat have been prepared in the ./locales/ folder
So, you can just update "locales/en.yml" and run this tools, it will automatically translate to all languages.

You can just run :

```bash
pnpm generate:locales

# or :

node ./tools/translator.js ./locales en.yml
```

### Icons

This project using unplugin-icons for auto generate and import icon as component.

You can see collection icon list in : [https://icones.js.org/](https://icones.js.org/)

you can use `<prefix-collection:icon />` or `<PrefixCollection:Icon />`.

in this project, configuration prefix as a "icon", you can see in `vue.config.ts` :

```js
export default definevueConfig({
    ...

    vite: {
        plugins: [
            UnpluginComponentsVite({
                dts: true,
                resolvers: [
                    IconsResolver({
                        prefix: 'Icon',
                    }),
                ],
            }),
        ],
    },

    ...
})
```

Example :

```vue
// use icon from collection "Simple Icons" and name icon is "vuedotjs"
<IconSimpleIcons:vuedotjs />

// use icon from collection "Unicons" and name icon is "sun"
<IconUil:sun />
```

### Precommit and Postmerge

This project using husky and commitlint for precommit and postmerge.
when you commit, it will check your commit message and running "pnpm lint-staged" to check your staged files.
configuration in : `/path/to/.husky/pre-commit` and `/path/to/commitlint.config.js`

And when Postmerge, it will run "pnpm" to automatically install new dependencies.
configuration in `/path/to/.husky/post-merge`
